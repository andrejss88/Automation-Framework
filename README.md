# Selenium-Page-Object-Framework
Selenium (Java) Maven project with multiple examples on how to do things differently. 

(!) Important (!): This framework was created with the main purpose to serve as an entry point for beginners in Selenium automation. It has relatively simple yet flexible class hierarchy and composition design for its size and purpose. This repo will not be developed further to maintain its beginner-friendly level. It's meant to be tried out, extended and experimented upon. So consider it as a "Snapshot". A copy of this framework will continue to evolve in the repo "AutomationFramework", an umbrella repo for all sort of automation testing.

Includes and demonstrates:

- Various ways to fetch Page Elements: by Id, Class, Xpath, etc.
- Traditional Arrange / Act / Assert tests
- An alternative simple Fluent Interface that uses the Builder pattern to make test actions more descriptive
- Usage of Java8 Functional Interfaces and streams
- Custom annotations and TestNG so-called "listeners" that leverage Java reflection to manipulate test behaviour
